<h1>Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression</h1>

<p>This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients. The model is built using Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. The project aims to provide an accurate and reliable prediction based on various health-related features.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. In this project, we utilize a dataset containing various medical attributes, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.</p>

<h2>Model Performance</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Training Accuracy:</strong> 85%</li>
  <li><strong>Testing Accuracy:</strong> 80%</li>
</ul>

<p>The model was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on unseen test data to ensure its generalization capability. The performance metrics indicate that the model has learned to generalize well, with a slight drop in accuracy when applied to new data, which is expected in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python</li>
  <li><strong>Libraries:</strong> Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Selection of the most relevant features for better model performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Implementation of Logistic Regression to predict heart disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Analysis of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository.</li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies.</li>
  <li>Run the notebook or script to train the model and evaluate its performance on the test data.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression for predicting heart disease, achieving an 85% accuracy on the training data and 80% accuracy on the test data. The model's performance highlights its potential use in real-world scenarios for early diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>
